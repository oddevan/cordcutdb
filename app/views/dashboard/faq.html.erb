# Frequently Asked Questions #

## What even is this? ##

The mission of the Cordcut DB is to be a comprehensive listing of premium over-the-top 
television and video providers that are driving the internet-based television world forward.

## What are the requirements to be in the database? ##

There are (currently) 3 rules to be in the database:

1. Service is available regardless of internet provider.
2. Service should not require single-purpose equipment.
3. Service has clear out-of-contract pricing.

## Can you elaborate? ##

Sure!

Regarding rule 1:

- If a service requires internet service from a particular provider, it is disqualified.
- This doesn't disqualify things like address-based or region-based access. That's an
  unfortunate reality of the TV world right now. It will go away eventually, but I say
  we pick a different battle first.

Regarding rule 2:

- Requiring specific general-purpose hardware (like gaming consoles, set-top boxes, and smart TVs 
  with access to multiple apps and services) is acceptable.
- Requiring a set-top box that can only be used with the service and provides no other value is not.
- Basically, there's more than one reason to buy a PS4, an Amazon Fire TV, or an Apple TV. There's
  no reason to buy a DIRECTV set-top box except to use with DIRECTV.

Regarding rule 3:

- While a service can advertise special limited rates or promotions in exchange for a service contract, 
  it must be clear what rates will be after the contract.
- There should also be an option to forgo a contract.
- We as viewers should be able to easily sign up for and cancel services. Barriers to entry and exit,
  if any, should be low.
- This rule is mostly in place because the database only lists non-promotional, out-of-contract prices.
  The price listed should be the most you will pay for a given service.[^pricing]

[^pricing]: This is because having to call the cable company and threaten to cancel every year because the price you’re paying now is more than double what it was when you signed up is the single biggest factor in me wanting to cut the cord and I want to see this practice die in a fire.

## What services are NOT in the database? ##

In addition to the usual suspects of traditional cable and satellite operators (who
by nature fail rules 1 and 2 and are generally bad about rule 3),
we have a list of [dishonorable mentions](/dishonorable-mentions/) for services
that _sound_ like they should be in the list and... well, aren't.
